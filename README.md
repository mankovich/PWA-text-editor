## Description 

This is a text editor comprising a single-page web application that runs in the browser but may also be installed as a progressive web application. The purpose of the application is to allow users to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection that may be easily retrieved later.

The application features a number of data-persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the user's browser. It also functions offline. The application stores and retrieves data on an IndexedDB database using the `idb` package. 

The application's URL is: [pwa-text-editor.onrender.com](pwa-text-editor-mod-19.onrender.com)
